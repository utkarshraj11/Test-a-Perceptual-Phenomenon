# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I also learnt a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went through the task. Looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results.
